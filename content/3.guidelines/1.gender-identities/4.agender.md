## Overview

Undercharge is a solo developed game about the effects of [Burnout Syndrome], and was developed using Unreal Engine 4.

It was created with self imposed restrictions of a four hour time limit, and the exclusive usage of Unreal Engine default assets.

## Design

### Movement & Stress

In Undercharge the player controls a rolling ball which them can move inside a small arena.

As the ball moves, the player accumulates "Stress", an invisible metric that will only lower once they release the movement inputs. The more Stress the player has, the slower the ball will move, eventually halting all movement.

This Stress is displayed both visually and auditorily, with the usually green-glowing ball tinting towards red, the player's viewport gaining a red hue, and the game's soundtrack increasing dramatically in volume.

### Pickups & Score

The game's objective is to obtain the highest score within the least amount of time. Score is obtained by rolling the ball over pickups that are periodically spawned around the arena.

The amount of score each pickup grants depends on the player's current Stress level at the time of interaction - the more stressed, the lower the points, being even possible for a pickup to grant no score at all.

### Metal Health Awareness

The game's design is intended to illustrate the effects of Burnout Syndrome, which is most commonly caused by severe and sequential periods of overwork.

The reduction in score for gathering pickups with high Stress acts as a parallel to how the symptoms of burnout include a drop in performance and enjoyment of activities

The game's instructions and mechanics and purposefully kept vague as the design's objective is to cause a natural realisation on part of the player that the best strategy to accumulate points is to alternate between moments of action and moments of rest. Akin to the preventative measures to the disease, continuous movement will exponentially slow down the ball and prevent point accumulation.
