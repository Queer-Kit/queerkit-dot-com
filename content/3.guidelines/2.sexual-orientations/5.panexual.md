Grand Tale is my largest project and what I consider to be my life's work. It's a long-term goal developed in my personal time, and is not yet funded. 

As of the time being, I'm responsible for all narrative, game design, code, and documentation within this project.

## What is Grand Tale?

Grand Tale is an entertainment media franchise cetered around a video game by the same name, which is the focus of this article.

The game is a multiplayer isometric social [Life Sim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_simulation_game) in which the player controls a character named "Ori", a member of the "Grand Tale" - an adventurer organization with aims to revolutionize the world. To tackle this grand task, Ori must aid the Grand Tale in recruiting allies, gathering resources, upgrading their estate, and learning about the vast world around them.

Upon entering the world, players are able to customize Ori and the Grand Estate, their base of operations which may be visited by other players and upgraded by spending resources. They may then engaeg in either resource gathering in an outside overworld, idle activities such as sending workers on expeditions or researching upgrades, or simply socializing with others.

That's Grand Tale's core experience, which is also a base for the game's most important feature - Tales.

In "elevator pitch" terms, Grand Tale is [Club Penguin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_Penguin) + [Stardew Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stardew_Valley), but instead of Club Penguin's mini-games there are large and complex sub-games.

## Tales

Tales are self-contained complete sub-games within Grand Tale, including features such as matchmaking and individual progression. They may be of various other game genres (MOBA, RTS, Roguelite, Autobattler, etc).

From within Grand Tale's base experience players may choose to engage in any of these Tales, which then plug into the base experience's system (i.e. a different type of Expedition or Research which is themed around a given Tale).

Although multiple game genres taking place within the same franchise is nothing new (i.e. the [League of Legends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_League_of_Legends_media) franchise), what sets Grand Tale apart is the integration.

Due to being inside the same game and being designed this way from the start, the degree of interconnectivity Grand Tale offers allows for narrative and game design opportunities not traditionally available.

While players may engage with a single Tale (or even solely with the base game) and still have a complete experience, they are highly incentivized to play multiple Tales and add further depth to their involvement with the franchise.

The experience of playing Grand Tale is enhanced if you play multiple Tales, but not everyone enjoys multiple types of games. Many aspects of the game's design ensure players don't feel hindered by not engaging with a given Tale.

This is an overview of some of the Tales currently in development:
